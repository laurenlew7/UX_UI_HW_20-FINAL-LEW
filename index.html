        <p class="lead">A complete redesign of the Colorado Animal Rescue website, on mobile and desktop. Using user research to high-fidelity prototypes.</p>
        <img id="carMock" src="images/desktop mockup for Colorado Animal Rescue 1.png">
        <hr class="my-4">
  <p>The Colorado Animal Rescue is a non-profit organization based out of Glenwood Springs, Colorado. In our redesign of their website, we will be focusing on improving the current information architecture and user interfaces while also highlighting the core values, missions, and key intentions that the Colorado Animal Rescue upholds. Our main emphasis will be on improving the pathway that connects potential adopters to the animals in need at the Colorado Animal Rescue to clarify the calls to action an adopter must make to translate their desire to adopt into action.  </p>

            <h3> Along with conducting user interviews and a heuristic evaluation, we were able to gather key pieces of information from our interviews in order to create an user persona to help guide our solution come to life.  We learned that a lot of users tend to prefer an in-person adoption process rather than online, due to lack of information or just confusion in general.</h3>

            <h3> We were able to pinpoint a problem statement and follow our user persona, Amanda, through the steps towards creating and iterating a reliable user flow in order to maximize usability on the Colorado Animal Rescue website. Our team decided to include a “pet personality quiz” in order to match potential adopters with animals within their comfort zone to ensure the best care for their future companion. </h3>

            <h3> This part of the phase was really enjoyable to sift through all of the ideas my teammates and I had. With the sitemap and user flow, we followed our set path yet were able to tap into our creativity and watch our ideas come to life. We took the insight that we got from user usability tests to polish up our UI and make the redesign as smoothly as possible. Some roadblocks were prioritizing where information needed to go, as long as clarifying their adoption process page.</h3>

            <h3> Overall this project emphasized the step by step process it takes to get from research to product, while providing beneficial insights and feedback from teammates and users. We were able to clean up the UI, and if the duration on this project were lengthened, a future iteration would be to highlight 
                information about the ASPCA pet personalities quiz prior to the user taking the quiz to aid in understanding of quiz results.</h3>
